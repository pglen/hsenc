 This directory contains misc tests needed during development.
For example a question on what happens when you truncate a file
to a shorter length, and then expand that file --> will it ...

  a.) preserve the old data b.) zero it c.) fill it with undefined data
 
Believe it or not, the answer is not as intuitive as it sounds.

  This simple test revealed that windows will preserve the excess data,
Linux will zero it, OS-ABC-XX will fill in random data. Some Unix-s will
behave different if the file is a sparse file ... (Note we obfuscated the 
OS name here)
