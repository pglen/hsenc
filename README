Uesful trick to see the logs in a separate file.

Edit (Create) /etc/rsyslog/rsyslog.d/10-custom.conf
with the following contents:

if $programname == 'HSENCFS' then {
        /var/log/hsencfs.log
        ~
}


Announcement

 The source code copied out to the ecrypted directory does NOT compile in that
directory correctly.

This means the file access intercept is not random clean,
as GCC acesses object files by chunk.

 The trick was to pre read to the encryption buffer boundary, and then
  Decrypt / Patch / Encrypt / Write.

 The last buffer may be partial, so special arragements are made to
accomodate that.
